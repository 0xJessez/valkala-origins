##  :pushpin: ABOUT

Valkala Origins is a full stack application which aims to take you through the life cycle of a modern day Orc.

Summon -> Battle -> Rest -> Craft Gear (and get stronger) -> Repeat -> Profit?

## :rocket: Technology

The following technologies and frameworks were used:

- React
- Express (dotenv, bcrypt, nodemon)
- JavaScript (vanilla plus the above)
- HTML
- CSS / SASS
- Figma
- VSCode

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

## :cry: Challenges faced
- Adapting to the React framework was difficult at first and caused me to underestimate the amount of time needed to do different task 
- The were a number of hiccups getting the backend to communicate locally and even when fixed these persisted to the deployment stage


## :scream: Bugs to fix
- The app is still under construction

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- Planning should be taken more seriously. I believe my lack of thorough planning caused me to progress slower than expected as it's difficult to make inroads when the task is big with many different directions

## :white_check_mark: Future Features
- By completion of development I hope to have an app where you can create different orcs (via initial randomised summoning), battle monster and craft gear
